Quadrapeds vs Coffins
========================

A game to be played on car trips.

- the car is devided into two teams split between port and starboard.
  - any middle passengers may choose a team to play on, or act as referee and scorekeeper.
- the goal of the game is to have more instances of spotting four-legged animals than the other team.
- points are given per sighting of quadrapeds, not per individual quadrapeds
- sightings must be at least 1/4 Mile apart
  - They must be called by the team on the same side of the vehicle as the quadraped.
  - quadrapeds are split into 2 categories:
    - livestock
       - 1 point per sighting
       - live on agricultural land
       - cared for by a farmer
       - are not household pets
       - if playing outside of Australia and New Zealand, emu count for 2 points
       - cows count for 2 points per sighting
    - wildlife
       - live in the wild
       - are not dependant on particular humans for survival
       - wild cows count as an instant win
       - wild baby rabbits count for 10 points
- points are removed by a team sighting a cemetery on the opposing teams side. The team on the side of the cemetery lose all their points.
- a location counts as a cemetery if any bodies are buried marked by a headstone visible from the road.
- in the event a cow is in a sighted cemetery, everyone wins and is awarded ice cream by the driver
