Quadrapeds vs Coffins
========================

A game to be played on car trips

- the car is divided into two teams split between port and starboard
  - any middle passengers may choose a team to play on, or act as referee and scorekeeper
- the goal of the game is to spot and count more four-legged animals than the other team
- points are given per sighting, not per individual quadrapeds
- sightings must be at least 1/4 Mile apart
  - They must be called by the team on the same side of the vehicle as the quadraped/s
  - quadrapeds are split into 2 categories:
    - livestock
       - live on agricultural land
       - cared for by a farmer
       - are not household pets
       - are worth 2 points per sighting of cows
       - are worth 1 point per sighting of non-cows
       - if playing outside of Australia and New Zealand, emu sightings are worth 2 points
    - wildlife
       - live in the wild
       - are not dependant on particular humans for survival
       - are worth 10 points per sighting of wild baby rabbits
       - are worth 1 point per sighting of non-wild baby rabbits
       - wild cows count as an instant win
- cemeteries on your side must be politely ignored
- sighting a cemetery on the opposing teams side causes the opposing team to lose all their points from cows
- a location counts as a cemetery if any bodies are buried marked by a headstone visible from the road
- in the event a cow is sighted in a cemetery, everyone wins and is awarded ice cream by the driver
